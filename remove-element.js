 /* 
 Certainly, the provided code defines a function named `removeElement` that modifies an array `nums` in-place to remove all instances of a given value `val`. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

**Functionality:**

- The function takes two arguments:
  - `nums`: An array of integers.
  - `val`: The specific integer value to be removed from the `nums` array.

- It removes all occurrences of `val` from `nums` without creating a new array. 
- The function modifies the original `nums` array such that elements not equal to `val` are shifted towards the beginning of the array. 
- Elements at the end of the array might be overwritten.

**Logic Breakdown:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `k` is declared and initialized to `0`. This variable acts as a counter to keep track of the index where the next valid element (one that is not `val`) should be placed in the `nums` array.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The function iterates through the `nums` array using a `for` loop. 
   - For each element `nums[i]`, it checks if it's not equal to the value to be removed (`val`) using an `if` statement.

3. **Shifting Elements (if val not found):**
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, it means it's a valid element that needs to be kept.
   - The value of `nums[i]` is then copied to the index pointed to by `k` in the `nums` array. This essentially shifts the valid elements towards the beginning of the array.
   - After copying the element, the value of `k` is incremented by 1 to point to the next available index in the `nums` array for the next valid element.

4. **Return value:**
   - After the loop completes iterating through all elements, the final value of `k` is returned. This `k` represents the new length of the array excluding the removed elements (elements equal to `val`).

**In summary:**

The `removeElement` function efficiently removes elements with a value of `val` from the `nums` array by shifting valid elements and tracking the new length using `k`. The original `nums` array is modified in-place to save space.
